<h1>E-Commerce Webpage</h1>
Welcome to my project repository! I'm excited to share that this e-commerce webpage is fully completed. Designed as a test project, it's intended to demonstrate a complete, functional setup rather than for live sales. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its key features:

User Accounts: Secure login and personalized account management.
Admin Panel: A powerful backend interface to manage products, user data, and orders.
Security: Robust measures to ensure a safe, simulated environment.
Modern Design: A sleek, responsive front end built with the latest Bootstrap framework.
Shopping Cart and Checkout: A complete cart system, with a PayPal-integrated checkout model for testing payment flows.
<h1>Project Highlights</h1>
Front-End: Developed using Bootstrap for a clean, user-friendly interface.
Back-End: Powered by Django, providing robust functionality and scalability.
Payment Simulation: Integrated with PayPal to demonstrate secure transactions in a test environment.
This project is fully set up for demonstration purposes, offering a modern e-commerce experience without actual product sales. I hope it provides a clear view of my approach and capabilities in e-commerce development!
